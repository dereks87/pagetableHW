I considered the following software licenses:

1) MIT License
   Summary: Short and permissive; allows use, copy, modify, and redistriute, including proprietary code, as long as the copyright and warranty disclaimer are kept. Simple, compatible with courses.

2) Apache License 2.0 (permissive with patent grant)
   Summary: Permissive like MIT but adds an express patent license and patnt-termination clause. Good for broader reuse with some patent safety.
   Factors that mattered: Explicit patent terms, widely accepted in industry.

3) GPL v3.0
   Summary: Grants rights to use, modify, and redistribute, but works must also be licensed under GPL v3. Includes anti-tivoization provisions.
   Factors that mattered: Allows for improvements remain to open, but less convenient for integration into proprietary or mixed code.

Chosen license: MIT License
Reasons:
- Easiest for course distribution and reuse with minimal obligations
- Keeps barriers low for graders and classmates who may want to experiment or adapt small parts
- No copyleft constraints or notice/patent housekeeping needed for this asignment
